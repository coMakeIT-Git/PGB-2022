1. Create a class - Take a meaningful class name - e.g. Employee, Country, Student, Birds, Animal and so on
2. Add attributes to class - Add Associated attribute to the class you chosen
3. Add Constructor to Class - Add default and parameterized constructor to class
4. Add getter and setter to Class variables
5. Override equals and hashCode method from object class
6. Add method in class for equality check of class Objects
7. Create two objects of class and do equality check with above method.
8. Showcase method overloading by creating the methods for the class created at step 1
9. Create a class with two functions one recursive and one non recursive. Either of these function should be
capable of calculating the factorial of a number.
10. Create another class to call the factorial methods of class created in step 12 and write the output.
11. Write a Generic class in java.
12. initialize generic class created in step 12 with different data type (For example with String and Integer type)
13. Add a method to the class that returns and print the data when called using generic class object.
