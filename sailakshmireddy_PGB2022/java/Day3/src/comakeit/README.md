1. Add an Interface

3. Add an abstract class
4. Add method with definition in abstract class
5. Implements methods of Interface class in concrete class
6. Override the methods of abstract Class in concrete class
7. create objects of concrete class
8. Access the Abstract class methods
9. Access the Concrete class methods
10. Create collections list, set and map of objects from concrete class
11. Iterate and print list, set and Map build in step 10
12. Sort the collections of list build in step 10
13. use java stream to iterate the list built in step 10
14. Write a program which prints the position of characters occurring in a string
(i.e., which characters occur at which position in a string).
Read the string from the command line.
For example if string is  "Hello World"
{d=[9], o=[4, 6], r=[7], W=[5], H=[0], l=[2, 3, 8], e=[1]}
